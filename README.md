# 👋 Hi, I’m Ido (@ido745)

I am a **Computer Science Student** and **Software Developer** currently working part-time in **BI and Data Science**. 
My fields of interest and personal projects sit at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Game Development**, and **Mathematics**.

### 🛠️ What I’m Working On
* **Professional Experience:** Developing and managing data solutions in the **Business Intelligence and Data Science** space.
* **AI & Logic:** Developing a high-performance **Chess Engine** in C# utilizing Bitboards, Zobrist Hashing, and Alpha-Beta pruning.
* **Computer Graphics:** Building a custom **3D Rendering Engine** in C++ using OpenGL to master the graphics pipeline and shader programming.
* **Systems Architecture:** Implementing scalable backends, including a **C++ File Management Server** and collaborative full-stack applications.

### 🧠 Areas of Interest
* **Deep Learning:** Training and deploying Neural Networks (like my **Doodle Guesser CNN**) using TensorFlow and Flask.
* **Game Engineering:** Moving beyond high-level engines to understand engine architecture, networking, and memory management.
* **Mathematics:** I have a strong interest in mathematical problems in general, specifically those that translate to programmable solutions and projects.

### 💻 Technical Stack
| Category | Tools & Languages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | C++, C#, Python, JavaScript (Node.js), SQL |
| **Graphics/Games** | OpenGL, GLSL, Unity, Bitboards |
